## 2025-03-05 - Expensive inline template calculations in Vue 3
**Learning:** In Vue 3, complex inline template expressions like `string.split('\n').filter().length` are evaluated on every re-render (which happens on every keystroke in a form). If this expression is used multiple times (e.g., inside a `v-for` and multiple interpolation tags), the performance penalty is multiplied by the number of usages.
**Action:** Always move complex derived state from templates into `computed` properties. Vue will cache the computed result based on its reactive dependencies, preventing redundant calculations on every render cycle.
## 2025-04-15 - Unnecessary reactivity in static components
**Learning:** In Vue 3, computing static arrays that never change wastes reactivity overhead. `computed` is useful for tracking reactive dependency changes, but using it with static data imports from a router file only adds overhead without any benefit. Also, typing must strictly be updated whenever an interface expects newly referenced props (e.g. `title`, `icon`).
**Action:** Replace `computed` functions with simple variable assignments (e.g., `const tabs = promptRoutes.map(...)`) when dealing with statically configured values that do not rely on reactive Vue state.
## 2025-07-07 - Avoid unnecessary array allocations in string parsing
**Learning:** Using `split('\n').filter(...)` creates multiple intermediate arrays, causing significant garbage collection overhead and potential O(N^2) regressions for large strings. A direct string scanning `while` loop using `indexOf` avoids memory allocation entirely and guarantees O(N) performance.
**Action:** Replace functional array methods on strings with allocation-free loops when scanning for characters or substrings in performance-sensitive contexts.
